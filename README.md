# Dry Canal

This project, implemented by the HikerBots team, is a solution to a much bigger problem than we expected, which is traffic in the Panama Canal. 

A Dry Canal, also known as a "Canal Seco" (DC), consists of two major ports, one located on the Pacific Ocean and the other on the Atlantic, connected by a set of roads or railways with sufficient travel speed and load capacity to move the entire cargo of a Panamax ship (60,000 tons or 3-5 thousand TEUs). It also requires a series of logistical facilities to expedite the exchange of goods between one side and the other. This dry canal is intended to assist the flow of the Panama Canal by capturing 20% of the overflow.  Some of the problems that this dry canal would have are unloading efficiency and efficient truck movement. 

The Dry Canal proposed by HIKERBOTS begins at Puerto CortÃ©s (HOPYZ), Honduras, and ends at Puerto Cutuco (PCT), La UniÃ³n, El Salvador. It is a 377 km route that takes approximately 6 hours by road. 81% of the route is in Honduras, and 19% is in El Salvador. 

We selected this project because it is important to our country and will help not only the efficiency of the Panama Canal but also the economic growth of our country. In the region, the Dry Canal becomes a viable option due to:

- **Shorter transit times**. Panama takes between 7 and 10 days to enter the Canal and 10 hours to pass. The route is highly congested.

- **Cost reduction**. Panama entails a cost of approximately $1 million for the vessel's passage, plus operational costs of the ship during waiting time.

- **Diversification of routes**. It reduces reliance on waterways, which can be affected by climate Change and droughts.

- **Economic stimulation**. The operation of the ports involves the construction of large infrastructure projects, the creation of services and thousands of jobs, and the introduction of technology and automated solutions in communities and in the two countries.

This solution consists of upgrading the existing machinery used to unload the cargo ships with sensors and machines that will make the machine automatic. We will also upgrade with new technology the trucks used to move the cargo so that they are automated. 

The value that this project has is that it revolutionizes the routes of cargo ships, helps the growth of the countries that are involved in the project, and, in the long term, will help Panama. For us, this project is the fastest and most efficient way to help with the problems of overflow in the Panama Canal. This project is focused on helping maritime companies like Maersk or Crowley that have transportation problems and constant delays with their cargo. By doing this project, we ensure to improve the feasibility and speed of maritime cargo.


## Who will it help? How important is it?

- **Directly:** benefits the builders of the infrastructure necessary for the project, the architects, civil engineers, bricklayers, etc. 

- **Indirectly:** people like the ladies of the small stores, gas stations, suppliers of materials necessary for construction, etc. These people would be positively affected, as would the governments of Honduras and El Salvador and the societies of these countries, since the income that these projects generate could be used for improvement projects for the country, such as improvements to public schools, hospitals, or even the country's road system.

The project is **important** not only because it helps container traffic between seas globally but also because it helps the economic growth it would have in the countries involved. It is important because it generates jobs such as recalibration of sensors, motors, or programming for industrial machines, among other jobs required in the use and repair of technology.
